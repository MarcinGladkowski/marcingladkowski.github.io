This year - i mean 2020 was an unusual year for everyone - I think.
Therefore each should summarize own actions. In this post I will write what i have achieved in 2020
and what i want to achieve in 2021.

In last few days I created this blog. It's another shoot to still practicing writing blog posts.

How looks this year on github ? Not bad, not good.
