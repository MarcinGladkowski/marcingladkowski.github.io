This year conference [PHPcon Poland 2022](https://2022.phpcon.pl/) was so special for me. Everything because I presented a topic
"Memory leaks in long processes - practice". On material I worked with [Łukasz Jaworski](https://www.linkedin.com/in/%C5%82ukasz-jaworski-977078130). For me and Łukasz
it was the first time as presenters. That experience gives me a lot of confidence and bravery. As a programmer 
I always wanted to do something for community by first open source commits and share knowledge, my point
of see.
